## 🔧 Installation

To install this community node, follow the instructions in the [n8n community node installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/).

```bash

````

After installing, restart n8n and the node will be available in the editor.

## 📌 Supported Operations

This node currently supports the following operations on **Contacts**:

* ✅ Create Contact
* ✅ Update Contact
* ✅ Get Contact by ID
* ✅ Get All Contacts

More modules (like Invoices, Payments, etc.) will be added in future releases.

---

## 🔐 Credentials

To authenticate with the LEDGERS API, you must provide the following:

* **X-API-Key** – [Get your API Key from LEDGERS](https://ledgers.cloud/c/developers)
* **Email** – Your registered LEDGERS account email
* **Password** – Your LEDGERS account password

> ⚠️ The node performs a login to retrieve an `api_token`, which is used in all subsequent API requests. If login fails, the node will return the appropriate error message from the API.

## 🚀 Usage

3. Enter your `X-API-Key`, `email`, and `password`.
4. Use the **LEDGERS** node to perform contact-related operations.

Example: To create a new contact, choose **Create Contact** as the operation and provide the required fields.

## ⚠️ Error Handling & Continue On Fail

This node supports **"Continue On Fail"**, meaning:

* If one item fails (e.g., due to an invalid contact ID or missing required field), it logs the error and continues processing the rest of the items.
* If disabled, the node stops execution upon the first error.

You can enable this in the node's settings under the **"Continue On Fail"** option.
