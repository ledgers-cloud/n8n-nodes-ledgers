## üîÑ Error Handling & Continue On Fail

This node supports **"Continue On Fail"**, meaning:

* If one item fails (e.g., due to an invalid ID or missing required field), it logs the error and continues processing the rest of the items.
* If disabled, the node stops execution upon the first error.
* Validation errors are clearly communicated with specific error messages.

You can enable this in the node's settings under the **"Continue On Fail"** option.
